## Project Name: Poolen

**Project Description:** <br/>
**Poolen** is a simple prototype of betting application built on top of lens network to handle picking meme & distributing rewards once the time ends. We used the Lens v3 integration with Connectkit to connect as well as utilised the usage of v3 lens sdk to onboard mulitple users. Poolen handles or works as contract that enables the txns based on smart wallet account instance supported by lens i.e. we don't use the EOA wallet address to sign the txns on contract rather use lens account instace for every procedure. Having such use case we can easily bind the username that were being transacting in our contract even if the single EOA wallet handles multiple lens account addresses.
